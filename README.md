it’s automated response from anyone that try to message you.
from any topics you think of.

Bot is a software that automates things that we do.

Why this is necessary?
1.	people spend 80% of time in just 3 apps a da
2.	9 out of 10 top used apps were made by Google and Facebook.

what my bots can do?
3.	Get customized notifications and news. A bot can act as a smart newspaper, sending you relevant content as soon as it's published.
4.	Integrate with other services. A bot can enrich chats with content from external services like IMDB, Wiki, YouTube, GitHub, Foursquare....
5.	Create custom tools. A bot may provide you with alerts, weather forecasts, translations, formatting or other services.
6.	Build single and multiplayer games. A bot can play chess and checkers against you, act as host in quiz games, or even take up the dungeon master's dice for an RPG.
7.	Build social services. A bot could connect people looking for conversation partners based on common interests or proximity.
8.	Do virtually anything else. Except for time travel. They just can't do it. Yet!
